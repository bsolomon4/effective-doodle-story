It was a cold evening in Madison, Wisconsin. The sky was pitch black, clouds slightly illuminated by the residual glow of light streaming through various building windows or streetlights. However, one window did not have any light shining out of its window. Rather, a soft glow was contained in the room by a single candle placed on a table. Sitting at that table, was a man completely focused on a sketch. His name was Ed, and he was preparing for a drawing contest.
