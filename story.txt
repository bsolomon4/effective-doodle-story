It was a cold evening in Madison, Wisconsin. The sky was pitch black, clouds slightly illuminated by the residual glow of light streaming through various building windows or streetlights. However, one window did not have any light shining out of its window. Rather, a soft glow was contained in the room by a single candle placed on a table. Sitting at that table, was a man completely focused on a sketch. His name was Ed, and he was preparing for a drawing contest.


Hope Ed draws something good might be hard to see.

Ed worked and toiled well until the hours of the night: he painstakingly worked and perfected his ideas as his artistic vision eluded him. As the clock struck 4, he finally took a step back from his work, and prepared to submit it the next day.

Ed's hard work had paid off, and he won the contest. Unfortunately, as he was stepping off the stage, a 100 ton anvil fell on his head and flattened him like a cartoonish pancake.
THE END.
